# Mama 5 Fitness

I wanted to create this website for my aspiring and motivating Mother. She is a mother of 5 ! Hence Mama-5-Fitness. She is pursuing her passion in fitness and health helping people across the nation improve their routine, regiment, and way of life on a constant basic. Her unselfishness has inspired me to create this for her as a way for her to be able to showcase herself virtually! This site will have information about her business as well as her! I will be incorporating a "assistant" which will be a 24/7 virtual bot that can answer many FAQ that you may be curious about! This will also have links to her other sites which have individual needs!

I originally created this site using nodeJS, express, and mongoDB. This was the first back-end stack I learned. I constructed the front-end using React JavaScript. But I have come to find a passion for writing programs in Python and have stumpled across the magnificient web framework Django to be able to compile Python in the browser! I hope to be able to finish this project for my mother and be able to follow through with the features I have set for this application!
